      <p>
        A computer is an advanced electronic device that operates on the
        principle of the IPOS cycle: Input, Process, Output, and Storage. It
        takes raw data as <strong>Input</strong> from the user or other sources
        (e.g., keyboard, mouse, sensors). This data is then
        <strong>Processed</strong> under the control of a set of instructions (a
        program), transforming it into meaningful information. The result of
        this processing is then presented as <strong>Output</strong> (e.g., on a
        screen, printer, or speakers). Finally, this output or intermediate data
        can be <strong>Stored</strong> for future use or retrieval. Essentially,
        a computer is a programmable machine designed to automatically carry out
        a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations with high speed and
        accuracy, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and
        problem-solving.

      <h2>1.2 History of Computer</h2>
      <p>
        The journey of computers began long before the electronic devices we
        know today. Early computing devices were mechanical, designed to aid in
        calculations. Key milestones include:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Abacus (circa 2700–2300 BC):</strong> One of the earliest
          known computing devices, used for basic arithmetic, particularly in
          ancient civilizations for trade and accounting. Its simple yet
          effective design allowed for manual calculation of sums and
          differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Napier's Bones (1617):</strong> Invented by John Napier, these
          were manual calculating tools used for multiplication and division,
          simplifying complex calculations through a system of movable rods with
          numbers inscribed on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pascaline (1642):</strong> Blaise Pascal invented this
          mechanical calculator, capable of addition and subtraction. It was one
          of the first mechanical calculators that could perform arithmetic
          operations automatically, albeit limited to addition and subtraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leibniz Calculator (1672):</strong> Gottfried Leibniz improved
          upon Pascal's design, adding multiplication and division capabilities.
          This marked a significant step towards more versatile mechanical
          computation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Difference Engine and Analytical Engine (1820s-1830s):</strong
          >
          Charles Babbage, often considered the "Father of the Computer,"
          conceptualized these machines. The Difference Engine was designed to
          compute polynomial functions, while the Analytical Engine was a more
          ambitious, general-purpose programmable computing machine, featuring a
          'mill' (CPU), 'store' (memory), and input/output devices, laying
          theoretical groundwork for modern computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tabulating Machine (1890):</strong> Herman Hollerith developed
          this machine to process data for the U.S. Census, using punched cards.
          This invention significantly reduced the time required for data
          tabulation and marked the beginning of automated data processing. His
          company eventually became IBM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Z1 (1938):</strong> Konrad Zuse created the first
          electro-mechanical binary programmable computer. This pioneering
          machine, though mechanical, introduced key concepts like binary
          representation and programmability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) (1937-1942):</strong>
          Considered the first electronic digital computing device, it
          introduced concepts like binary arithmetic and regenerative memory,
          laying crucial groundwork for future electronic computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
            (1946):</strong
          >
          The first general-purpose electronic digital computer, built for the
          U.S. Army. Its immense size and power marked a new era in computation,
          capable of solving a wide range of numerical problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I) (1951):</strong> The
          first commercial computer produced in the United States, notable for
          handling both numerical and textual information and for its role in
          predicting the 1952 presidential election.

        The evolution of computers is often categorized into generations, each
        defined by significant technological advancements that led to more
        powerful, smaller, cheaper, and efficient machines. Understanding these
        generations provides insight into the rapid progress of computing
        technology.

                <li>
                  Generated a lot of heat, prone to malfunctions: The vacuum

        <li>
          <strong>Speed:</strong> Computers can perform calculations and process
          data at incredibly high speeds, far exceeding human capabilities. This
          speed is measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS) or
          billions of instructions per second (BIPS), enabling rapid execution
          of complex tasks and real-time data processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Computers are highly accurate and
          consistent in their operations, producing precise results every time.
          Errors usually occur due to incorrect input data (GIGO - Garbage In,
          Garbage Out), faulty programming, or hardware malfunctions, not
          inherent computational errors by the computer itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diligence:</strong> Unlike humans, computers are free from
          monotony, tiredness, and lack of concentration. They can perform
          repetitive tasks with the same speed and accuracy for extended periods
          without any degradation in performance, making them ideal for
          continuous operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Versatility:</strong> A computer is a versatile machine
          capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from complex scientific
          calculations and data analysis to simple word processing, graphic
          design, and entertainment. This adaptability is achieved simply by
          changing the program or software it runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage Capability:</strong> Computers can store vast amounts
          of data and information, including text, images, audio, and video, in
          various storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs, cloud storage). This
          data can be retrieved quickly and efficiently whenever needed, forming
          the backbone of modern information systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automation:</strong> Once a program is initiated, a computer
          can perform tasks automatically without continuous human intervention.
          This capability allows for the execution of complex sequences of
          operations, greatly increasing efficiency and reducing manual effort
          in many processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability:</strong> Modern computers are designed to be
          highly reliable, with components that have a long lifespan and
          consistent performance. With proper maintenance and stable operating
          conditions, computers can function for extended periods without
          failure, ensuring continuous operation for critical tasks.
