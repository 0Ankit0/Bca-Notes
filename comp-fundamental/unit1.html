      </figure>
      <p>
        A computer is an advanced electronic device that operates on the
        principle of the IPOS cycle: Input, Process, Output, and Storage. It
        takes raw data as <strong>Input</strong> from the user or other sources
        (e.g., keyboard, mouse, sensors). This data is then
        <strong>Processed</strong> under the control of a set of instructions (a
        program), transforming it into meaningful information. The result of
        this processing is then presented as <strong>Output</strong> (e.g., on a
        screen, printer, or speakers). Finally, this output or intermediate data
        can be <strong>Stored</strong> for future use or retrieval. Essentially,
        a computer is a programmable machine designed to automatically carry out
        a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations with high speed and
        accuracy, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and
        problem-solving.
      </p>

      <h2>1.2 History of Computer</h2>
      <p>
        The journey of computers began long before the electronic devices we
        know today. Early computing devices were mechanical, designed to aid in
        calculations. Key milestones include:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Abacus (circa 2700–2300 BC):</strong> One of the earliest
          known computing devices, used for basic arithmetic, particularly in
          ancient civilizations for trade and accounting. Its simple yet
          effective design allowed for manual calculation of sums and
          differences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Napier's Bones (1617):</strong> Invented by John Napier, these
          were manual calculating tools used for multiplication and division,
          simplifying complex calculations through a system of movable rods with
          numbers inscribed on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pascaline (1642):</strong> Blaise Pascal invented this
          mechanical calculator, capable of addition and subtraction. It was one
          of the first mechanical calculators that could perform arithmetic
          operations automatically, albeit limited to addition and subtraction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leibniz Calculator (1672):</strong> Gottfried Leibniz improved
          upon Pascal's design, adding multiplication and division capabilities.
          This marked a significant step towards more versatile mechanical
          computation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Difference Engine and Analytical Engine (1820s-1830s):</strong
          >
          Charles Babbage, often considered the "Father of the Computer,"
          conceptualized these machines. The Difference Engine was designed to
          compute polynomial functions, while the Analytical Engine was a more
          ambitious, general-purpose programmable computing machine, featuring a
          'mill' (CPU), 'store' (memory), and input/output devices, laying
          theoretical groundwork for modern computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tabulating Machine (1890):</strong> Herman Hollerith developed
          this machine to process data for the U.S. Census, using punched cards.
          This invention significantly reduced the time required for data
          tabulation and marked the beginning of automated data processing. His
          company eventually became IBM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Z1 (1938):</strong> Konrad Zuse created the first
          electro-mechanical binary programmable computer. This pioneering
          machine, though mechanical, introduced key concepts like binary
          representation and programmability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) (1937-1942):</strong>
          Considered the first electronic digital computing device, it
          introduced concepts like binary arithmetic and regenerative memory,
          laying crucial groundwork for future electronic computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
            (1946):</strong
          >
          The first general-purpose electronic digital computer, built for the
          U.S. Army. Its immense size and power marked a new era in computation,
          capable of solving a wide range of numerical problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer I) (1951):</strong> The
          first commercial computer produced in the United States, notable for
          handling both numerical and textual information and for its role in
          predicting the 1952 presidential election.

      <h2>1.3 Generations of Computer</h2>
      <p>
        The evolution of computers is often categorized into generations, each
        defined by significant technological advancements that led to more
        powerful, smaller, cheaper, and efficient machines. Understanding these
        generations provides insight into the rapid progress of computing
        technology.

        these in detail.
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Speed:</strong> A computer is a very fast device. It can perform a large amount of calculations in a few seconds. The speed of a computer is measured in terms of microseconds (10^-6), nanoseconds (10^-9), and picoseconds (10^-12). A powerful computer is capable of performing about 3-4 million simple instructions per second.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> The accuracy of a computer is consistently high. The degree of accuracy of a particular computer depends on its design. Errors can occur in a computer, but these are mainly due to human rather than technological weakness. This is often referred to as Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diligence:</strong> A computer is free from tiredness, lack of concentration, fatigue, etc. It can work for hours without creating any error. If millions of calculations are to be performed, a computer will perform every calculation with the same accuracy. Due to this capability, it is more reliable than human beings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Versatility:</strong> Versatility is one of the most wonderful features of a computer. It can perform a wide range of tasks. One moment it can be used to prepare a document, the next moment it can be used to play a game, and so on. All this is possible by simply changing the program that is loaded into the computer's memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage Capability:</strong> A computer has a very large memory. It can store a large amount of data. The storage capacity of a computer is measured in terms of kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB). A computer can store data for a long time and can retrieve it whenever required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automation:</strong> A computer is an automatic machine. Once a program is given to the computer, it can work automatically without any human intervention. The computer can be programmed to perform a series of tasks automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability:</strong> A computer is a reliable machine. Modern electronic components have long lives. Computers are designed to make maintenance easy.
