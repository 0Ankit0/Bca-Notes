          <strong>Impact Printers:</strong> These printers create an image by
          physically striking an inked ribbon against the paper. They are
          generally noisier but can produce carbon copies.
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">
            <li>
              <strong>Dot Matrix Printers:</strong> Use a print head that moves
              back and forth, or in an up and down motion, and prints by impact,
              striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper. They are
              known for their durability and ability to print multi-part forms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Daisy Wheel Printers:</strong> Use a "daisy wheel" element
              that contains pre-formed characters. A hammer strikes the
              character against the ribbon and paper. They produce high-quality
              text but cannot print graphics.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Impact Printers:</strong> These printers create characters
          and graphics on paper without any physical contact between the
          printing mechanism and the paper. They are generally quieter and
          produce higher quality output.

            <li>
              <strong>Inkjet Printers:</strong> Create images by propelling
              droplets of ink onto paper. They are popular for home and small
              office use due to their ability to print both text and
              high-quality color graphics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Laser Printers:</strong> Use a laser beam to create an
              image on a photosensitive drum, which then attracts toner
              (powdered ink). The toner is transferred to the paper and fused
              with heat. Laser printers are known for their high speed,
              high-quality text, and cost-effectiveness for high-volume
              printing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Thermal Printers:</strong> Use heat to produce an image on

        <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> Expect questions on the importance
        and examples of ergonomically designed devices and how they enhance user
        efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ergonomics is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding
        of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the
        profession that applies theory, principles, data, and methods to design
        in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. In
        the context of computing, ergonomically designed devices and
        workstations aim to reduce user fatigue, discomfort, and the risk of
        long-term health issues (such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, repetitive
        strain injuries, and back pain) by optimizing the interaction between
        the user and their computer equipment. This leads to increased
        efficiency, productivity, and a healthier work environment.
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Ergonomic Keyboards:</strong> These keyboards are designed to
          promote a more natural hand and wrist position. Examples include
          split-design keyboards that separate the keys into two or more
          sections, negative tilt keyboards that angle downwards away from the
          user, and those with integrated padded wrist rests. These features
          help reduce strain on wrists and forearms, minimizing the risk of
          conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ergonomic Mice:</strong> Designed to fit the natural contours
          of the hand and keep the wrist in a neutral "handshake" position. This
          category includes vertical mice, trackball mice (where the ball is
          manipulated by the thumb or fingers), and contoured mice with
          specialized grips. They aim to reduce wrist pronation and repetitive
          movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjustable Monitors:</strong> Ergonomic monitors offer a wide
          range of adjustments, including height, tilt, swivel, and pivot. This
          allows users to position the screen at an optimal eye level,
          preventing neck and eye strain, reducing glare, and promoting a
          comfortable viewing angle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ergonomic Chairs and Desks:</strong> These are fundamental to
          an ergonomic workstation. Ergonomic chairs provide adjustable lumbar
          support, seat height, armrests, and backrest recline to support the
          natural curve of the spine and promote good posture. Adjustable desks
          (sit-stand desks) allow users to alternate between sitting and
          standing positions, reducing the negative effects of prolonged
          sitting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Document Holders:</strong> Position documents at the same
          height and distance as the monitor to reduce neck and eye movement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Footrests:</strong> Support feet and promote proper leg
          circulation, especially for users whose feet don't comfortably reach
          the floor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Ergonomic Guidelines for Computer Users:</strong> Adhering
        to these guidelines can significantly improve comfort and reduce health
        risks associated with prolonged computer use:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Posture:</strong> Maintain a neutral posture with a straight
          back, shoulders relaxed, feet flat on the floor (or on a footrest),
          and arms parallel to the floor. Elbows should be at a 90-degree angle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitor Distance and Height:</strong> Position the monitor at
          arm's length (about 20-40 inches) from your eyes, with the top of the
          screen at or slightly below eye level. This prevents neck strain and
          reduces eye fatigue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Breaks:</strong> Take frequent short breaks (e.g., every 20-30
          minutes) to stand up, stretch, and rest your eyes. The 20-20-20 rule
          (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) can
          help reduce eye strain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lighting:</strong> Ensure adequate and glare-free lighting to
          prevent eye strain. Avoid direct glare on the screen from windows or
          overhead lights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Input Device Placement:</strong> Keep the keyboard and mouse
          close to your body to avoid overreaching, which can strain shoulders
          and arms.
        </li>
      </ul>
