        <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> Defining AI and explaining its
        real-world applications is a very common question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad and rapidly evolving field of
        computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing
        tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves the
        development of systems that can perceive their environment, reason,
        learn, and make decisions to achieve specific goals. The core idea
        behind AI is to simulate and automate human cognitive processes.

        <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> Explaining different types of
        machine learning with examples is a common question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful subset of Artificial Intelligence
        that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience
        without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. Instead
        of following static instructions, ML algorithms use statistical methods
        to analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and make predictions or
        decisions based on the learned patterns. This adaptive capability is
        what makes ML so transformative across various industries.
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Core Principle:</strong> The fundamental idea behind ML is to
          "train" a model on data. The model then uses this training to
          generalize to new, unseen data. This is in contrast to traditional
          programming, where every rule and logic path must be explicitly coded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Types of Machine Learning:</strong> ML is typically
          categorized into three main types based on the nature of the learning
          signal or feedback available to the learning system:
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">
            <li>
              <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong>
              <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px">
                <li>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> The model learns from "labeled"
                  data, which means the input data is paired with the correct
                  output. The goal is to learn a mapping function from the input
                  to the output so that it can predict the output for new,
                  unseen inputs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Common Tasks:</strong> Classification (predicting a
                  category, e.g., spam or not spam) and Regression (predicting a
                  continuous value, e.g., house prices).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Examples:</strong> Predicting house prices based on
                  features like size, location, and number of bedrooms
                  (regression); classifying emails as spam or not spam
                  (classification); image recognition (identifying objects in
                  images).
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> The model learns from
                  "unlabeled" data, meaning there are no correct output values
                  provided. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or
                  relationships within the data itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Common Tasks:</strong> Clustering (grouping similar
                  data points), Association (finding relationships between
                  variables), Dimensionality Reduction (reducing the number of
                  features).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Examples:</strong> Customer segmentation (grouping
                  customers with similar purchasing behaviors); anomaly
                  detection (identifying unusual patterns, e.g., fraudulent
                  transactions); organizing large datasets into meaningful
                  categories.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong>
              <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px">
                <li>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> The model (an "agent") learns by
                  interacting with an environment, performing actions, and
                  receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The
                  goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward
                  over time.

        <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> Blockchain technology is a common
        short note question. Understand its key features and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchain is a revolutionary decentralized, distributed, and often
        public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many
        computers (nodes) in a network. Each transaction or data record is
        grouped into a "block," and these blocks are cryptographically linked
        together in a sequential "chain." This structure ensures that once a
        block is added to the chain, it is extremely difficult to alter any
        record retroactively without changing all subsequent blocks and
        achieving consensus from the majority of the network participants. This
        inherent security and transparency are what make blockchain technology
        so disruptive.
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>
          <strong>Key Features:</strong>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralization:</strong> There is no central authority
              (like a bank or government) controlling the network. Instead, the
              network is maintained by a distributed peer-to-peer network of
              computers, making it resistant to single points of failure and
              censorship.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a transaction or data record
              is validated and added to a block, and that block is added to the
              chain, it becomes virtually impossible to change or delete it.
              This creates a permanent and tamper-proof record.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> All participants in the network can
              view the entire ledger (though identities can be pseudonymous, as
              in cryptocurrencies). This transparency fosters trust and reduces
              the need for intermediaries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security:</strong> Cryptography is used extensively to
              secure individual blocks and link them together. Each block
              contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring the
              integrity and authenticity of the entire chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consensus Mechanism:</strong> Blockchains use various
              consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) to
              validate new blocks and ensure that all participants agree on the
              state of the ledger.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Blockchain technology extends far
          beyond cryptocurrencies:
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">
            <li>

              origin to consumer, enhancing traceability and reducing fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Digital Identity:</strong> Creating self-sovereign digital
              identities that users control, reducing reliance on central
              authorities for verification.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Enhancing the security,
              transparency, and verifiability of electoral processes.

              <strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing contracts with
              the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They
              automatically execute when predefined conditions are met, without
              the need for intermediaries.

        <strong>Exam Question Alert:</strong> IoT is another common short note
        topic. Focus on its definition and real-world examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a vast and growing network of
        physical objects—"things"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and
        other technologies. These "things" are connected to the internet,
        enabling them to collect and exchange data with other devices and
        systems over various communication networks. The core idea of IoT is to
        extend internet connectivity beyond standard devices like computers and
        smartphones to a wide range of everyday objects, allowing them to become
        "smart" and interact with each other and with us, often without
        requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
